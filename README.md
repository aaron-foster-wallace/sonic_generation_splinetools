# sonic_generation_splinetools
sonic generation splinetools for blender
The plugin suport  `*.path.xml` and also support write and read directly to  the `#level.ar` files.

If an arfile is used it will create a collection having the splines with the same filename of the `*.path.xml`  in the ar file for each one.

For exporting , it will export all splines to a file, or if you select an ar file it will create the spline files if the collection having the curves have a  name ended in .path.xml,(like is created when you import)

The plugin is based in the information of http://info.sonicretro.org/SCHG:Sonic_Generations  and its contributors
